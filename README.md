# Real-Life-Traffic-Generator

## Project Description
This project focuses on generating real-life network traffic scenarios using labeled network traffic flows datasets obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jsrojas/labeled-network-traffic-flows-114-applications/data). By leveraging tools like Scapy, iperf, and DITG, this project aims to simulate and analyze network traffic patterns from Docker hosts in the Mininet environment. The dataset is modified such as IP source and destination to adapt to the Mininet environment, ensuring compatibility with the network emulation framework.
